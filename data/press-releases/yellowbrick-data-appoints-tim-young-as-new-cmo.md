**MOUNTAIN VIEW Calif.—March 8, 2022—**Yellowbrick Data, the leader in Distributed Data Cloud architecture for data warehousing, has appointed Tim Young as Chief Marketing Officer.

Leading the company’s aggressive marketing agenda, Tim brings his track record as a builder and go-to-market expert in data warehousing, AI, and analytic markets representing hyper-growth brands including DataRobot and Netezza with the latter resulting in a $1.7b exit when acquired by IBM. 

“Tim brings extensive knowledge and experience in scaling disruptive technology companies that are on a rapid growth trajectory,” said Neil Carson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Yellowbrick Data. “Having built category-leading recognition for global data and analytics brands, we are fortunate to have him on the team as we enter our next stage of growth, turning Yellowbrick into the stand-out story of 2022.”  

Tim Young has more than 25 years of experience marketing technology in AI, machine learning, big data, cloud, and analytics markets. He has built and led global marketing teams, created categories, developed global brands, and maximized revenue opportunities for recognition-deficient companies, leading to significant financial outcomes including three acquisitions. Most recently, Tim built and led global marketing for DataRobot. Before that, he held executive marketing roles at Workday, IBM, and Netezza, where he created the Netezza (now IBM) and TwinFin brands.
