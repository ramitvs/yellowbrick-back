**MOUNTAIN VIEW Calif.—April 28, 2022**—Yellowbrick Data, the leader in Distributed Data Cloud architecture for data warehousing, today announced that Zurich North America (Zurich), one of the largest providers of insurance solutions and services, selected Yellowbrick to replace its legacy on-premise data warehouse with a robust cloud-based architecture. **Yellowbrick** has enabled Zurich to decrease the time to produce business-critical, end-of-month reports by 55%. Zurich was also able to accelerate SAS processes from hours to minutes.

“In choosing a cloud data warehouse provider, we were focused on two main things: price for performance and ease of migration. Yellowbrick met our needs in both key areas and has begun to establish a strong relationship with us,” said **Denise Birdsell**, Head of IT Data Management at **Zurich** at **Zurich North America**. “We run complex workloads that require Postgres compatibility, seamless integrations with Informatica, and hybrid cloud flexibility. Our choice to move forward with Yellowbrick benefits our large-scale, end-of-month reporting needs and allows us to update our risk models and reporting environment faster than ever before.” 

Zurich offers property, casualty, and life insurance products and services. Its customers range from individuals to small, mid-sized, and multinational companies. The company sought a solution that could synthesize its massive quantity of multinational datasets for day-to-day use and company-wide reporting. **Yellowbrick** set itself apart by running complex test queries on an 80TB dataset, with 100+ concurrent reports executing simultaneously. Yellowbrick outpaced Zurich’s current solution, delivering results in seconds as opposed to days.

“As a leading insurance provider, Zurich’s key focus areas include optimizing monthly reporting and claims-handling processes and protecting against the next risk. Yellowbrick’s elastic data warehouse helps Zurich gain critical business insight from their data including validating insurance pricing and evaluating data on policies sold and claims made,” said **Neil Carson**, CEO and Co-founder at Yellowbrick. “With our low acquisition and operating costs combined with high performance, we are fundamentally changing the economics of enterprise data warehousing. We look forward to seeing continued results and evolving with Zurich’s business.”
